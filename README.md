# Caliper Keyboard - Digital Caliper Data Over Bluetooth

This poject's goal is to provide a remote interface to the various cheap Digital Calipers: below is a photo of one such product.  
This project's firmware is being developed on Zephyr Version 3.3.99.  
The Nordic nRF52 series Developemt Kits are the target hardware platform: PCA10040 (nRF52832) and PCA10056 (nRF52840).
These two boards are use for early development; there will be new board specifically designed to be affixed to the back of a caliper.
