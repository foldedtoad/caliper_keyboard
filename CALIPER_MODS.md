# Caliper Modifications

## Caliper Disassembly and Modification

This document shows how to modify a Digital Caliper to expose an interface cable.

Open the package and take out the battery from the battery compartment.

Turn the caliper over to its back side and remove the metallic sticker.

Remove the four screws from the back.

Seperate the two halves of the caliper into main body side and ruler side.

On the main body, there are three screws holding the PCB to the case: remove these screws.

The main body can now be seperated into three pieces: the plastic case, the LCD screen, and the PCB board.

On the top side of the plastic case are two existing holes.   
The hole on the right (above the battery compartment) should be enlarged with a Dremel tool and burr.

Below is shows the general type of flat ribbon cable with female BLS sockets on each end.

Seperate three strands of wires from the ribbon cable.  
**NOTE:** The red, orange and yellow strands are used in this document.   
Cutting a ready-made 10 inch ribbon cable in half, two caliper cable could be made, although only one is needed.  
Remove the three single-pin headers and replace them with a single 3-pin header as listed below. 


  * Lift the little catches on each single header, then pull the pin out of it's socket.  
  * Insert each pin back into the 3-pin socket, insuring the little catch reseats on the pin.  
  Notice that the orange and yellow wires cross over: yellow wire in the middle position of the header.  
  * Finally, strip and tin the opposite end of the cable.

Loop the cable through the newly created hole in the plastic case.  
Now, solder the ends to the pads on the PCB as ahown below.

## Caliper Reassembly

  *  Carefully replace LCB display in plastic case, insuring that the Zebra strips are in their correct location over the PCB's display pads.
  *  Slide the PCB board, with newly attached cable, into the plastic case. Be sure that plastic case alignment pins, near the screw holes, are seated fully.
  *  Replace the three screws holding the PCB to the plastic case. Do this carefully and look for any mis-alignments of the PCB.
  *  The main body of the plastic case has two "wipers" that prevent dirt from entering the main body when fully assembled: one at each end of the ruler tract.  These wipers need to be retained in their slots. A small strip of non-conducting material may be inserted into the slot beside the wiper, thus shimming the wiper into the slot.   
  **HINT:** The battery activation strip (white plastic strip) makes for readily available shimming material.
  *  On the ruler side, be sure that flat, v-shaped spring is still pressing against the top of the ruler slider. Also push the ruler to the "zero" position: fully left.
  *  Carefully flip the main body onto the ruler so that body left side seats onto the ruler's zero mark.
  *  Holding the two halves together, flip the whole assemembly over and replace the four screws on the back side.
  *  Reinsert the battery and battery case cover.
  *  Turn the caliper on and check that it still operates as expected: digital readout displays values, and ruler slides easily (no binding).
