## Simple, Signal Inverting Level Shifter

A simplified level shifter circuit schematic is seen below.

While this design is simple to construct, it does have an oddity in that the input signals are inverted on the output side.
This inverted signals situation is handled in the firmware code running on the microprocesssor.

Building this type of level shifter can be easily constructed on a "mini" breadboard block, as shown below.
